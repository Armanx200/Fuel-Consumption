# Fuel Consumption Prediction using Linear Regression 🚗💨

This repository contains code to predict fuel consumption using linear regression based on vehicle features.

## Overview 📊

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts fuel consumption based on various vehicle features. The dataset used is 'FuelConsumption.csv', which contains information about fuel consumption and vehicle attributes.

## Technologies Used 💻

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage 🚀

1. Place your dataset 'FuelConsumption.csv' in the project directory.
2. Run the `fuel_consumption_prediction.py` script to train the model and generate predictions.
3. View the results and model evaluation metrics.

## Results 💯

The linear regression model achieves an R-squared score of 0.98 on the test data, indicating a good fit.
